# CryptoX

## About CryptoX
CryptoX is an open-source encryptor and decryptor.
It uses the AES method for encrypting, but I'm planning on adding more encryption methods in the near future.
This method supports any 256 bit keys (The most secure key AES has), but I will add the ability to choose how many bits you want soon.
CryptoX also contains a simple UI.

## How to install:
[Click here](https://github.com/blahberi/CryptoX/releases/download/v2.0/CryptoXinstaller.msi) to download the installer.

## How to use:
- Add files into CryptoX by dragging and dropping them, or with the file menu at the top.
- Encrypt or decrypt the files by clicking the encrypt or decrypt buttons.
- Save the key as binary in a file, or copy it as text to share it with other people (Make sure you securily send the key!)
- Generate a new key by clicking on the generate key button.
## ⚠WARNING⚠ 
Generating a new key will completely overwrite the old key.<br>
There will be **no way** of getting that key back. all of the files that are still encrypted with the old key will be lost **permanently**.<br>
I am not responsible for lost files, **use at your own risk!**
