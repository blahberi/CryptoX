# CryptoX

## about CryptoX
CryptoX is an open-source aes encryptor and decryptor.
it contains a simple ui.
it encrypts with aes encryption(more encryption methods comming soon)
this method supports any 256 bit keys(the most secure key aes has) but u will be able to select smaller keys in the future.

## how to install:
1) download the app from github
2) extract the zip and run the app(im working on an installer)
   you're done :)

## how to use:
1) get a file that you want to encrypt and drag it into the app
2) you can also browse your file explorer and select the file within the app
3) once the app is in the encryptor
4) select your operation(encrypt or decrypt)
   you're done :)

   you also have a generate key. this option will generate a new key and replace it with the old one

   ## ⚠warning⚠ 
   generating a new key will completely overwrite the old key
   there will be no way of getting that key back. all of the files that are still encrypted with the old key will be lost permenatly.
   im not responsible for lost files. use at your own risk!

   we are currenty working on a fix to that. this will make generating a key decrypt all files that are encrypted and reencrypt them with the new key

   this feature is currently not in the app and we will remove this warning once it is
